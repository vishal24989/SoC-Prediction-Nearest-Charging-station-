# SoC-Prediction-Nearest-Charging-station-

This project creates a model for predicting a vehicle's battery State of Charge (SOC) and a web application for predicting SOC and suggesting the nearest charging station. 
The application, built with Streamlit, uses the model to predict SOC based on user inputs, finds the nearest available charging station, and displays the results and a map with directions. 
The application is deployed on Streamlit Sharing, and the datasets and code are available on GitHub.
